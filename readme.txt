Easily Send SMSes on Wordpress. Search, Compare and Buy the best SMS products.

== Description ==

[Onehop](http://www.onehop.co) is the world's first SMS provider marketplace. You can search for text providers based on your industry and use case. You can also view the delivery rate and latency rate, so it is easy for you to compare SMS providers. Onehop adds transparency to the process of picking a text provider. Routing makes it easy for you to switch between text providers.

= Preface =

Texting helps retail customers know the status of their order, when it has been shipped and delivered. The immediacy of texting can also help online retailers keep tabs on their inventory, restocking in time, so they don't lose out on orders. Similarly, texting customers who were interested in an out of stock item when it is back in stock, can prompt them to place an order immediately.

By using Onehop on Wordpress, you can buy texts according to your use case. You can write templates based on various scenarios, for your convenience. Automating SMSs based on purchase process flows will also increase your operational efficiency. **Excited? Let's get started.**
